    <h1>Experiment Details</h1>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <!--Start of a bulleted list of the experiment description-->
    <p><ul>
        <li>
            College students consume surprising 
            quantities of caffeine on average. 
            This study seeks to determine if a 
            correlation exists between the amount 
            of caffeine an individual consumes daily 
            and that individual's grade point average 
            in school.
        </li>
        <li>
            The initial experiment included a group,
            which received daily caffeine equal to 
            the national average (Group A), a group
            which received twice the national daily
            average (Group B), and a control group
            which received a placebo (Group C). 
        </li>
        <li>
            Preliminary results indicate that average
            consumption of daily caffeine led to a 
            slight and steady increase in GPA 
            throughout the term. A higher than 
            average consumption of caffeine led to
            higher GPA initially, but then grades fell 
            off towards the end of the semester. Finally, 
            no consumption of caffeine led to neither a 
            significant increase or decrease in overall 
            GPA performance.

    <!--Started of a numbered list of the procedure-->
    <ol>
        <li>
            100 students were selected from volunteer 
            applicants between the ages of 18-22 years 
            old, with equal numbers of female and male 
            participants and with a starting GPA 
            between 3.2 and 3.3. <!--Insert the GPA link here-->
        </li>
        <li>
            Each student was assigned a number from 1-100
        </li>
        <li>
            Numbers were then randomly selected and 
            assigned to groups A, B, and C 
        </li>
        <li>
            Group A was given caffeine equivalent 
            to 3 cups of coffee per day (the national 
            average) <!--Insert the caffene link here-->
        </li>
        <li>
            Group B was given caffeine equivalent to
            6 cups of coffee per day
        </li>
        <li>
            Group C was given a placebo
        </li>
        <li>
            Grade point averages were tracked 
            throughout the term and averaged by 
            group at the <b>start</b> of the <b>semester</b>,
            at <b>midterm</b>, and after final grades 
            were submitted
        </li>
    </ol>
