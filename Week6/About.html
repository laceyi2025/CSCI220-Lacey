            Deer hunting in Indiana has a long and deep history. In times before there were season restrictions on deer, they were just allowed to be harvested
            whenever someone wanted to. In some areas there were reports of 65 deer being harvested in a day. All the way up until 1893 there were whitetails in Indiana. 
            The last deer to be killed in Indiana was in 1893 in Knox County. This lead to a hold on hunting the animals. Between the years of 1934 and 1942 there were 296 
            deer bought from the states of Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina for release into the state. The next year, 1943, the deer population was 
            estimated at 900. 8 years later, in 1951, was the first deer season in 58 years. This season was only three days long. From 1951 until the present seasons and 
            restrictions have changed. We are just glad to still be abel to harvest these animals. (<a href="https://www.in.gov/dnr/fishwild/3359.htm"> in.dnr.gov</a>)
            <br>
            <br>
            Small and other game hunting has always been around. These include squirrel (fox and gray), coyote, fox, roccon, opossum, turkey, fowl, and birds. 
            <br>
            <br>
            A standard hunting license is required to hunt all small game. However, indiana residents are allowed only 2 does(female deer) and 1 buck(male deer) per year with the 
            license.
            Extra tag and stamps are required to hunt all fowl and birds, including turkeys.
