            <h3>Methods</h3>
            In Indiana there are a few main ways to hunt. For small game it is the stalk style hunt where a hunter walks through the woods looking 
            for game. Once they are spotted, the chase is on. 
            <br>
            However, for most game there are only a couple ways to hunt them successfully. One is the treestand hunt. This is where a hunter uses some 
            sort of elevated structure, usually latched to a tree, but can also be a tripod, to sit and wait for the animals to walk passed. Then there is
            the bling hunt. This is where a hunter sits in a transportable, camoflauge shack, that keeps them hidden from the animals and sits and waits. 
            Finally, there is the ground sit. This is where a hunter walks into the woods and finds some kind of concealment on the ground to sit behind 
            to wait for the animals. All of these methods are very successful and reliable, it just depends on the area you hunt.

<h3>Public vs. Private</h3>
         In Indiana public and private land are very different in the area of rules and regulations. In both places however it is illegal to bait,
         snare, or trap deer to harvest them, as there is a fair chase law that must be followed. In public land treestands and ground blinds are not 
         allowed to be left over night. They must be brought in and taken out with the hunter. There are also public land areas that are archery only 
         hunting. Meaning no firearms of any kind are allowed. However, there are some places that allow firearms with certain regulations. You can find 
         thos regulations <a href="https://www.in.gov/dnr/fishwild/7389.htm#">here.</a> For Private land there are not many regulations. You can hunt how 
         you want, when you want (as long as it is in season), and use any legal weapon in its respective season. Treestands can stay up year-round and blinds 
         as well. As long as you are being ethical and following the fair chase law, private land is very leniant.
